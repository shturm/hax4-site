My first impressions on Alex were that he is a strong professional and dedicated to his practice. He was like an encyclopedia for programming languages and technical design. It was very impressive how much hard skills he had at such young age.

Alex guided me through all kinds of corner cases I had, while doing so for the others on the team. Our team has seen very high stress levels and I have seen Alex taking control over every situation. I was not surprised when he took on a better career offer for a foreign company.

I was a junior programmer when I started working with him. He saw me through lots of guidance to my current level - full stack software developer. I cannot imagine achieving as much without the shortcuts and role modeling I had the opportunity to have with Alex.

His proficiency in hard and soft skills are undisputed. But what I like best about him is that he is a good man and when he says "I'll call you some time" - he does call indeed. Alex and me are good friends now.

I strongly recommend working with Alex. Every form of cooperating with him is an opportunity.
